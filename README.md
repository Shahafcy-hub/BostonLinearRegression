this is a python project I made for portfolio purposes
Using this code, you can match a csv file to a linear regression, and get statistics on the quality of the fit
feel free to try the code!

simply run the python script, with an enviroment that has all the following pacages installed

Packages needed:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn

do not input any parameters in order to get the fit for house prices in boston
if you'd like you can try using the values "Ecommerce Customers" and "Yearly Amount Spent" in order to run a liniar fit on generated data
